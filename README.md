# Run it localy
It works way better on localhost, I'm tring to figure out why...

now it works on http://localhost:8080/

# known issues

When You are out of RAM you lose webgl context, you may get black screen when it happens, then the page will stop working, and it will require reload, if your RAM usage is still high, You may be unable to view page. If Your source map wont be higher than 4096 px, it should work fine
